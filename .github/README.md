### What is WireGuard?
WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.

---
### WireGuard Goals
 - strong, modern security by default
 - minimal config and key management
 - fast, both low-latency and high-bandwidth
 - simple internals and small protocol surface area
 - simple CLI and seamless integration with system networking

---
### Prerequisite
- CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Redhat, Raspbian
- Linux ```Kernel 4.1``` or newer
- You will need root access or a user account with `sudo` privilege.

---
### Installation
Lets first use `curl` and save the file in `/etc/wireguard/`
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/complexorganizations/wireguard-installer-manager/master/wireguard-server.sh --create-dirs -o /etc/wireguard/wireguard-server.sh
```
Than lets make the script user executable (Optional)
```
chmod +x /etc/wireguard/wireguard-server.sh
```
Its finally time to execute the script
```
bash /etc/wireguard/wireguard-server.sh
```
In your `/etc/wireguard/clients` directory, you will have `.conf` files. These are the client configuration files. Download them from your WireGuard Interface and connect using your favorite WireGuard Peer.

---
### After Installation
- Show WireGuard Interface
- Start WireGuard Interface
- Stop WireGuard Interface
- Restart WireGuard Interface
